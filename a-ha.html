Here I am
And within the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep
And she's sweeter now than the wildest dream
Could've seen her
And I watch her slipping away

But I know I'll be hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go

To find her again
Upon this, my dreams are depending
Through the dark
I sense the pounding of her heart next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find

So I guess I'll be hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and low
High
Do you know what it means to love you?

I'm hunting high and low
And now she's telling me
She's got to go away

I'll always be hunting high and low
Only for you (and now she's telling me)
Watch me tearing myself to pieces
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to

Oh
For you, I'll be hunting high and low
